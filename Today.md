#My Day Today
![An image of the cool stuff that happened today](http://image.boomsbeat.com/data/images/full/283229/damian-lillard-jpg.jpg)
Today was not particularly exciting for me. I had my circuit break so I lost power this morning, popped a bike tire, _and_ I think I may be getting sick.

**But** I did get the heat back on in my house after two days and my dog has been a very good boy tonight.

##Here's what I'd like to happen tomorrow:
* Meditate
* Enjoy the movie
* Get lots of sleep and feel better
* Blazers win

A quote about today:
>Mama told me
>Not to sell work
>17.5 same color t-shirt
>>Mama told ME
>Not to sell WORK
>17.5 same color T-SHIRT


	* A list of good Blazers players this year:
		>Damian Lillard
		>CJ McCollum
		>End of list

Here are the best Migos, in order:
1. Offset
2. Quavo
3. Takeoff


1997\. The Last time the Blazers were good.
